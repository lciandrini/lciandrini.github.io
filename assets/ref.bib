  abstract = {Experimental observations tracing back to the 1960s imply that ribosome quantities play a prominent role in determining a cell's growth. Nevertheless, in biologically relevant scenarios, growth can also be influenced by the levels of mRNA and RNA polymerase. Here, we construct a quantitative model of biosynthesis providing testable scenarios for these situations. The model explores a theoretically motivated regime where RNA polymerases compete for genes and ribosomes for transcripts and gives general expressions relating growth rate, mRNA concentrations, ribosome, and RNA polymerase levels. On general grounds, the model predicts how the fraction of ribosomes in the proteome depends on total mRNA concentration and inspects an underexplored regime in which the trade-off between transcript levels and ribosome abundances sets the cellular growth rate. In particular, we show that the model predicts and clarifies three important experimental observations, in budding yeast and               Escherichia coli               bacteria: i) that the growth-rate cost of unneeded protein expression can be affected by mRNA levels, ii) that resource optimization leads to decreasing trends in mRNA levels at slow growth, and iii) that ribosome allocation may increase, stay constant, or decrease, in response to transcription-inhibiting antibiotics. Since the data indicate that a regime of joint limitation may apply in physiological conditions and not only to perturbations, we speculate that this regime is likely self-imposed.},

  abstract = {Growing cells adopt common basic strategies to achieve optimal resource allocation under limited resource availability. Our current understanding of such ``growth laws'' neglects degradation, assuming that it occurs slowly compared to the cell cycle duration. Here we argue that this assumption cannot hold at slow growth, leading to important consequences. We propose a simple framework showing that at slow growth protein degradation is balanced by a fraction of ``maintenance'' ribosomes. Consequently, active ribosomes do not drop to zero at vanishing growth, but as growth rate diminishes, an increasing fraction of active ribosomes performs maintenance. Through a detailed analysis of compiled data, we show that the predictions of this model agree with data from               E. coli               and               S. cerevisiae               . Intriguingly, we also find that protein degradation increases at slow growth, which we interpret as a consequence of active waste management and/or recycling. Our results highlight protein turnover as an underrated factor for our understanding of growth laws across kingdoms.},

  abstract = {In cells and in in vitro assays the number of motor proteins involved in biological transport processes is far from being unlimited. The cytoskeletal binding sites are in contact with the same finite reservoir of motors (either the cytosol or the flow chamber) and hence compete for recruiting the available motors, potentially depleting the reservoir and affecting cytoskeletal transport. In this work we provide a theoretical framework in which to study, analytically and numerically, how motor density profiles and crowding along cytoskeletal filaments depend on the competition of motors for their binding sites. We propose two models in which finite processive motor proteins actively advance along cytoskeletal filaments and are continuously exchanged with the motor pool. We first look at homogeneous reservoirs and then examine the effects of free motor diffusion in the surrounding medium. We consider as a reference situation recent in vitro experimental setups of kinesin-8 motors binding and moving along microtubule filaments in a flow chamber. We investigate how the crowding of linear motor proteins moving on a filament can be regulated by the balance between supply (concentration of motor proteins in the flow chamber) and demand (total number of polymerized tubulin heterodimers). We present analytical results for the density profiles of bound motors and the reservoir depletion, and propose novel phase diagrams that present the formation of jams of motor proteins on the filament as a function of two tuneable experimental parameters: the motor protein concentration and the concentration of tubulins polymerized into cytoskeletal filaments. Extensive numerical simulations corroborate the analytical results for parameters in the experimental range and also address the effects of diffusion of motor proteins in the reservoir. We then propose experiments for validating our models and discuss how the `supply--demand' effects can regulate motor traffic also in in vivo conditions.},

It also reveals that translation output is governed both by initiation efficiency and elongation dynamics. By integrating genome-wide experimental data sets with simulation of ribosome traffic on all Saccharomyces cerevisiae ORFs, mRNA-specific translation initiation rates are for the first time estimated across the entire transcriptome. Our analysis identifies different classes of mRNAs characterised by their initiation rates, their ribosome traffic dynamics, and by their response to ribosome availability. Strikingly, this classification based on translational dynamics maps onto key gene ontological classifications, revealing evolutionary optimisation of translation responses to be strongly influenced by gene function.},

  abstract = {Motor enzymes are remarkable molecular machines that use the energy derived from the hydrolysis of a nucleoside triphosphate to generate mechanical movement, achieved through different steps that constitute their kinetic cycle. These macromolecules, nowadays investigated with advanced experimental techniques to unveil their molecular mechanisms and the properties of their kinetic cycles, are implicated in many biological processes, ranging from biopolymerization (e.g., RNA polymerases and ribosomes) to intracellular transport (motor proteins such as kinesins or dyneins). Although the kinetics of individual motors is well studied on both theoretical and experimental grounds, the repercussions of their stepping cycle on the collective dynamics still remains unclear. Advances in this direction will improve our comprehension of transport process in the natural intracellular medium, where processive motor enzymes might operate in crowded conditions. In this work, we therefore extend contemporary statistical kinetic analysis to study collective transport phenomena of motors in terms of lattice gas models belonging to the exclusion process class. Via numerical simulations, we show how to interpret and use the randomness calculated from single particle trajectories in crowded conditions. Importantly, we also show that time fluctuations and non-Poissonian behavior are intrinsically related to spatial correlations and the emergence of large, but finite, clusters of comoving motors. The properties unveiled by our analysis have important biological implications on the collective transport characteristics of processive motor enzymes in crowded conditions.},

We investigate analytically and numerically the dynamics of graphs under a parallel XOR updating scheme. This scheme is interesting because it is accessible analytically and its phenomenology is at the same time under control and as rich as the one of general Boolean networks. We give analytical formulas for the dynamics on general graphs, showing that with a XOR-type evolution rule, dynamic features are direct consequences of the topological feedback structure, in analogy with the role of relevant components in Kauffman networks. Considering graphs with fixed in-degree, we characterize analytically and numerically the feedback regions using graph decimation algorithms (Leaf Removal). With varying {$\gamma$}, this graph ensemble shows a phase transition that separates a treelike graph region from one in which feedback components emerge. Networks near the transition point have feedback components made of disjoint loops, in which each node has exactly one incoming and one outgoing link. Using this fact, we provide analytical estimates of the maximum period starting from topological considerations.},

In this work we extend this class of models and consider the two fundamental steps of the ribosome's biochemical cycle following a coarse-grained perspective. In order to achieve a better understanding of the underlying biological processes and compare the theoretical predictions with experimental results, we provide a description lying between the minimal ASEP-like models and the more detailed models, which are analytically hard to treat. We use a mean-field approach to study the dynamics of particles associated with an internal stepping cycle. In this framework it is possible to characterize analytically different phases of the system (high density, low density or maximal current phase). Crucially, we show that the transitions between these different phases occur at different parameter values than the equivalent transitions in a standard ASEP, indicating the importance of including the two fundamental steps of the ribosome's biochemical cycle into the model.},

Kinetics studies at the single-cell level will circumvent the limitations of bulk assays with asynchronous virus replication. We have implemented a "viro-fluidic" method, which combines microfluidics and virology at single-cell and single-virus resolutions. As an experimental model, we used standard cell lines producing fluorescent HIV-like particles (VLPs). First, to scale the strategy to the single-cell level, we validated a sensitive flow virometry system to detect VLPs in low concentration samples ({$\geq$}10\textsuperscript{4} VLPs/mL). Then, this system was coupled to a single-cell trapping device to monitor in real-time the VLPs released, one at a time, from single cells under cell culture conditions. Our results revealed an average production rate of 50 VLPs/h/cell similar to the rate estimated for the same cells grown in population. Thus, the virus-producing capacities of the trapped cells were preserved and its real-time monitoring was accurate. Moreover, single-cell analysis revealed a release of VLPs with stochastic bursts with typical time intervals of few minutes, revealing the existence of limiting step(s) in the virus biogenesis process. Our tools can be applied to other pathogens or to extracellular vesicles to elucidate the dissemination mechanisms of these biological nanoparticles.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

Low-abundance tRNAs decode rare codons slowly, but it is unclear which genes might be subject to tRNA-mediated regulation of expression. Here, those mRNA targets were identified via global simulation of translation. In-silico mRNA translation rates were compared for each mRNA in both wild-type and a tRNAGlnCUGtRNACUGGln\{{\textbackslash}rm\{tRNA\}\}\_\{\{{\textbackslash}rm\{CUG\}\}\}{\textasciicircum}\{\{{\textbackslash}rm\{Gln\}\}\} sup70-65 mutant, which exhibits a pseudohyphal growth phenotype and a 75\% slower CAG codon translation rate. Of 4900 CAG-containing mRNAs, 300 showed significantly reduced in silico translation rates in a simulated tRNA mutant. Quantitative immunoassay confirmed that the reduced translation rates of sensitive mRNAs were tRNAGlnCUGtRNACUGGln\{{\textbackslash}rm\{tRNA\}\}\_\{\{{\textbackslash}rm\{CUG\}\}\}{\textasciicircum}\{\{{\textbackslash}rm\{Gln\}\}\} concentration-dependent.

To validate this prediction experimentally, constitutive gcn2 kinase mutants were used to reduce in vivo translation initiation rates. This repaired the relative translational rate defect of target mRNAs in the sup70-65 background, and ameliorated sup70-65 pseudohyphal growth phenotypes.

For a system with nonidentical lattices, we find that when a subset of lattices undergoes a phase transition from low to high density, the entire set of lattice currents becomes independent of total particle number. We generalize our approach to systems with a continuous distribution of lattice parameters, for which we demonstrate that measurements of the current carried by a single lattice type can be used to extract the entire distribution of lattice parameters. Our approach applies to populations of TASEPs with any distribution of lattice parameters and could easily be extended beyond the mean-field case.},

We extend previous mean-field approaches and demonstrate that the pTASEP is equivalent to the exclusion process with dynamical defects (ddTASEP), thus broadening the scope of our investigation to a larger class of problems related to transcription and translation. We extend the mean-field theory to the open boundary case, revealing the system's phase diagram and critical values of entry and exit rates. However, we identify a significant discrepancy between theory and simulations in a region of the parameter space, indicating severe finite-size effects. To address this, we develop a single-cluster approximation that captures the relationship between current and lattice size, providing a more accurate representation of the system's dynamics. Finally, we extend our approach to open boundary conditions, demonstrating its applicability in different scenarios. Our findings underscore the importance of considering finite-size effects, often overlooked in the literature, when modelling biological processes such as transcription and translation.},

A mutant allele, sup70-65, induces pseudohyphal growth on rich medium, an inappropriate nitrogen starvation response. This mutant tRNA is also a UAG nonsense suppressor via first base wobble. To investigate the basis of the pseudohyphal phenotype, 10 novel sup70 UAG suppressor alleles were identified, defining positions in the tRNAGlnCUG anticodon stem that restrict first base wobble. However, none conferred pseudohyphal growth, showing altered CUG anticodon presentation cannot itself induce pseudohyphal growth. Northern blot analysis revealed the sup70-65 tRNAGlnCUG is unstable, inefficiently charged, and 80\% reduced in its effective concentration. A stochastic model simulation of translation predicted compromised expression of CAG-rich ORFs in the tRNAGlnCUG-depleted sup70-65 mutant. This prediction was validated by demonstrating that luciferase expression in the mutant was 60\% reduced by introducing multiple tandem CAG (but not CAA) codons into this ORF. In addition, the sup70-65 pseudohyphal phenotype was partly complemented by overexpressing CAA-decoding tRNAGlnUUG, an inefficient wobble-decoder of CAG. We thus show that introducing codons decoded by a rare tRNA near the 5{$\prime$} end of an ORF can reduce eukaryote translational expression, and that the mutant tRNACUGGln constitutive pseudohyphal differentiation phenotype correlates strongly with reduced CAG decoding efficiency.},

Despite the blooming research activity in this field, the structural characterization of these entities is very limited, and we still do not understand how the phase behavior is encoded in the amino acid sequences of the scaffolding proteins. Here we exploited explicit-solvent atomistic simulations to investigate the N-terminal disordered region of DEAD-box helicase 4 (NDDX4), which is a well-established model for phase separation. Notably, we determined NDDX4 conformational ensemble at the single-molecule level, and we relied on a ``divide-and-conquer'' strategy, based on simulations of various protein fragments at high concentration, to probe intermolecular interactions in conditions mimicking real condensates. Our results provide a high-resolution picture of the molecular mechanisms underlying phase separation in agreement with NMR and mutagenesis data and suggest that clusters of arginine and aromatic residues may stabilize the assembly of several condensates.},

  abstract = {Translation of proteins is a fundamental part of gene expression that is mediated by ribosomes. As ribosomes significantly contribute to both cellular mass and energy consumption, achieving efficient management of the ribosome population is also crucial to metabolism and growth. Inspired by biological evidence for nutrient-dependent mechanisms that control both ribosome-active degradation and genesis, we introduce a dynamical model of protein production, that includes the dynamics of resources and control over the ribosome population. Under the hypothesis that active degradation and biogenesis are optimal for maximizing and maintaining protein production, we aim to qualitatively reproduce empirical observations of the ribosome population dynamics. Upon formulating the associated optimization problem, we first analytically study the stability and global behaviour of solutions under constant resource input, and characterize the extent of oscillations and convergence rate to a global equilibrium. We further use these results to simplify and solve the problem under a quasi-static approximation. Using biophysical parameter values, we find that optimal control solutions lead to both control mechanisms and the ribosome population switching between periods of feeding and fasting, suggesting that the intense regulation of ribosome population observed in experiments allows to maximize and maintain protein production. Finally, we find some range for the control values over which such a regime can be observed, depending on the intensity of fasting.},

  abstract = {One of the main goals of ribosome profiling is to quantify the rate of protein synthesis at the level of translation. Here, we develop a method for inferring translation elongation kinetics from ribosome profiling data using recent advances in mathematical modelling of mRNA translation. Our method distinguishes between the elongation rate intrinsic to the ribosome's stepping cycle and the actual elongation rate that takes into account ribosome interference. This distinction allows us to quantify the extent of ribosomal collisions along the transcript and identify individual codons where ribosomal collisions are likely. When examining ribosome profiling in yeast, we observe that translation initiation and elongation are close to their optima and traffic is minimized at the beginning of the transcript to favour ribosome recruitment. However, we find many individual sites of congestion along the mRNAs where the probability of ribosome interference can reach 50\%. Our work provides new measures of translation initiation and elongation efficiencies, emphasizing the importance of rating these two stages of translation separately.},

The ability to systematically and predictably encode such programs would advance the engineering of synthetic organisms and ecosystems with rich signal processing abilities. Here we implement robust, scalable history-dependent programs by distributing the computational labor across a cellular population. Our design is based on standardized recombinase-driven DNA scaffolds expressing different genes according to the order of occurrence of inputs. These multicellular computing systems are highly modular, do not require cell-cell communication channels, and any program can be built by differential composition of strains containing well-characterized logic scaffolds. We developed automated workflows that researchers can use to streamline program design and optimization. We anticipate that the history-dependent programs presented here will support many applications using cellular populations for material engineering, biomanufacturing and healthcare.},
